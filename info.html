<h2  style="text-align: center;">Rise of a Visionary Leader</h2>Chhatrapati <b>Shivaji Maharaj</b>, born on <b>19 February 1630</b> at <b>Shivneri Fort</b>
 in present-day Maharashtra, was the founder of the <b>Maratha Empire</b> and a fearless visionary who championed the idea of 
 <b>"Swarajya"</b>—self-rule. Raised by his mother <b>Jijabai</b>, a deeply spiritual and wise woman, and mentored by 
 <b>Dadoji Kondadev</b>, Shivaji was instilled with values of <b>justice</b>, <b>courage</b>, and <b>devotion to his motherland</b>.
  Even as a teenager, he began assembling a loyal force and launched attacks to gain control of forts like <b>Torna</b>, 
  <b>Kondana</b>, and <b>Purandar</b>—challenging the <b>Bijapur Sultanate</b>. One of the most legendary moments of his life occurred in 
  <b>1659</b> during the encounter with <b>Afzal Khan</b>, a general sent to eliminate him. Shivaji, armed with a concealed
  <b>“wagh nakh” (tiger claws)</b>, defended himself and killed Afzal Khan, securing a major victory at <b>Pratapgad Fort</b>.
   This triumph set the stage for further expansion as he captured key forts like <b>Panhala</b> and <b>Vishalgad</b>,
    gaining fame as a brilliant <b>guerrilla tactician</b> and <b>military leader</b>. <hr>
<h2 id="Coronation" style="text-align: center;">Coronation, Governance, and Naval Strength</h2> 
Shivaji's bold actions drew the attention of the <b>Mughal Empire</b>, leading to a fierce confrontation. In <b>1664</b>, he plundered the wealthy Mughal port city of <b>Surat</b>, prompting Emperor <b>Aurangzeb</b> to act. After signing the <b>Treaty of Purandar</b> in <b>1665</b> and facing <b>house arrest in Agra</b> in <b>1666</b>, Shivaji made a daring escape using <b>fruit baskets</b>—a move that became legend. Resuming his campaigns, he was formally crowned as <b>Chhatrapati</b> on <b>6 June 1674</b> at <b>Raigad Fort</b>, marking the birth of the <b>sovereign Maratha rule</b>. His administration was marked by an <b>efficient revenue system</b>, <b>justice</b>, <b>religious tolerance</b>, and <b>merit-based governance</b> through the <b>Ashta Pradhan Mandal</b>. Recognizing the strategic need for a <b>naval force</b>, he built a strong <b>navy</b> and fortified coastal forts like <b>Sindhudurg</b> and <b>Vijaydurg</b>, keeping foreign powers at bay. This naval strength earned him the title <b>“Father of the Indian Navy.”</b> <b>Shivaji Maharaj’s legacy</b> lives on not just as a <b>warrior king</b>, but as a <b>just and enlightened ruler</b> who laid the foundation for a powerful and <b>self-reliant nation</b>. <hr><h1 style="text-align: center;"></h1>
 <h2 id="Fort" style="text-align: center;">Major Forts of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
<b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> strategically built and captured several forts to establish and secure his vision of <b>Swarajya</b>. His military journey began with the capture of <b>Torna Fort</b> in <b>1645</b>, followed by key forts like <b>Kondana (Sinhagad)</b>, where the legendary <b>Tanaji Malusare</b> sacrificed his life. The majestic <b>Raigad Fort</b> became his capital and the site of his grand <b>coronation in 1674</b>. At <b>Pratapgad Fort</b>, he famously defeated <b>Afzal Khan</b> using the concealed <b>wagh nakh</b>. <b>Rajgad Fort</b>, his earlier capital, was crucial for administrative and residential purposes. The <b>Purandar Fort</b> played a vital role during the <b>1665 treaty with the Mughals</b>. On the western coast, Shivaji fortified <b>Sindhudurg</b> and <b>Vijaydurg Forts</b> to build a strong <b>navy</b> and protect against sea invasions, earning him the title <b>“Father of the Indian Navy.”</b> <b>Panhala Fort</b> near Kolhapur served as a key defense point during battles with the <b>Adilshahi</b>, while <b>Vishalgad Fort</b> became famous for Shivaji’s daring escape and the heroic sacrifice of <b>Baji Prabhu Deshpande</b>. These forts, built across the <b>Sahyadris</b> and coastal regions, were not only military strongholds but also symbols of <b>Maratha pride</b>, <b>resilience</b>, and <b>sovereignty</b>. <br>
