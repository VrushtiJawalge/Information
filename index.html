         <p id="information">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (19 February 1630 â€“ 3
             April 1680) was one of the greatest Indian warriors and a 
             legendary ruler who founded the Maratha Empire in western India in
             the 17th century. Known for his valor, leadership, and strategic acumen, 
             Shivaji Maharaj challenged the dominance of the Mughal Empire and other
            regional powers.
           <br><br> Born at the Shivneri Fort in present-day Maharashtra, he was deeply 
            inspired by his mother Jijabai and his guru Dadoji Konddev.
            He took the oath of Swarajya (self-rule) and gradually carved out
            a powerful kingdom through both diplomacy and military skill.
            One of his greatest achievements was his coronation as 
            Chhatrapati (monarch) in 1674 at Raigad Fort</p>
